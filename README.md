# Visualizing Google Analytics Data using `gganimate` for `R`

I analyzing Google Analytics data on a daily basis. Most day it involves basic 
arithmetic, creating reports and dashboards. The dashboards can be basic
scorecards with a few charts but nothing super fancy.

As I continue to learn more about data visualization, I thought it would be
fun to learn more about Thomas Lin Pedersen's revamp of the
[gganimate](https://github.com/thomasp85/gganimate) pakcage for `R`.

My goal is to be able to give you some reproducible code that uses the
Google Anlytics Reporting API using `googleAnalyticsR` as well as some
queries for GA 360 customers who have data in BigQuery using `bigqueryr`.
